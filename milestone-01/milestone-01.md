## Introduction

Follow [this example](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/demo_project/blob/milestone1/docs/milestone1-547-example.md). [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7) is the Nature paper, and [this](https://figshare.com/s/74a5ea79d76ad66a8af8) is where the dataset was downloaded from. Milestone 1 [guidelines](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/milestone_01/milestone_01/).







Some columns are repeated several times, with each column having a single unique value. For example, columns 15-24 are "What prompted you to study outside your country of upbringing?", but each column only has 1 reason as an answer. Therefore, it seems intuitive to combine these for posterior analysis.
